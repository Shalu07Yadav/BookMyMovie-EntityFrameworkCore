# BookMyMovieApp
Here the task is to design and test 
to implement the Database First approach using Entity Framework 
Core. Here I created and manage a relational database for 
a movie ticket booking application through a data access layer 
developed using Entity Framework Core. 
BookMyMovieApp is a movie ticket booking application that enables 
users to browse movies, select theaters, and book tickets seamlessly. 
The application manages essential data such as user details, available 
movies, theater locations, and ticket bookings.
